Here are some projects I've been working on recently:

- [HOLOGRAF](http://holograf.io)
  - In this group project, we created a tool to visualize and interact with your JavaScript code in 3D. I used Three.js, React, and Jasmine extensively for this project.

- [Jauntly](http://gojaunt.co)
  - This project uses Ionic/AngularJS and a Mongo database with the Google Maps and Yelp APIs. This application provides walking tours and serves up content based on location.

- [Cloudbalance](https://cloudbalance.co)
  - This application allows users to manage their cloud storage accounts. For this project, I worked with React and the Google Drive and Dropbox APIs.

- [Caffeine Slot Machine](http://caffeine-slot-machine.herokuapp.com)
    - This project simply came from a day of practice in using custom CSS transitions, which is what all of the animations used. Please pay no mind to rest.
